If you painstakingly coil your fairy lights around your Christmas tree each year, you’ve been doing it all wrong. That’s according to 46-year-old Clare Hooper whose life hack for lighting up a Christmas tree has gone viral on TikTok.  In a video, which has had 2.4 million views, Hooper can be seen stringing her fairy lights from the bottom of the tree right up to the top, and back down again, so the lights fall vertically. “If you are coiling your Christmas lights you are doing it wrong,” Hooper says in her Christmas lights life hack video, posted at the end of November. “Decorating Christmas trees used to be part of my job. We used the zigzag method, it means you don’t waste lights around the back of your tree and if a set breaks you can take them off really easily.” Her quick tutorial has inspired others to share videos of their tree lights hung with the zigzag method too – and we have to admit, it does look great.
